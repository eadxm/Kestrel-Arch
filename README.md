Kestrel Arch is an automated, hyper-optimized Arch Linux deployment system. It transforms a complex, multi-hour command-line installation into a flawless, 3-minute graphical deployment. Utilizing a memory-safe **Rust and Slint GUI** alongside a robust Bash provisioning backend, Kestrel dynamically scales to your hardware, firmware, and network environment.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Dynamic Hardware Tuning:** Kestrel actively analyzes your machine during deployment to configure the optimal performance matrix, including ZRAM deployment, FSTRIM, and tailored I/O schedulers based on disk topology (NVMe/SSD/HDD).
* **Intelligent Graphics Provisioning:** Automatically detects NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel arrays. Configures native PRIME Offload and `switcheroo-control`, allowing dedicated GPUs to enter ultra-low power states (D3) when idle.
* **Kernel Optimization:** Defaults to the `linux-cachyos` kernel, utilizing BORE CPU scheduling, LTO, and 1000Hz tick rates for maximum desktop responsiveness.
* **Network Stability:** Automatically generates strict localhost bindings, effectively neutralizing known Arch Linux network-hang vulnerabilities.
* **Wayland-Native Kiosk:** The installer runs entirely in Wayland via the Cage compositor, delivering a lightweight, tear-free graphical experience.

## 🚀 Installation & Deployment

### Method 1: The Graphical ISO (Recommended)
We provide two pre-compiled ISO variants, both hosted on our lightning-fast **Hugging Face Global CDN** so you can max out your download speeds with absolutely no VPN required.

* **Offline ISO (~4.3 GB):** Features a full package cache. Deploy a complete desktop environment without an active internet connection.
* **Online ISO (~1.7 GB):** A lightweight net-installer that fetches the absolute latest packages during deployment.

1. **Download:** Navigate to the **[Releases](https://github.com/eadxm/Kestrel-Arch/releases)** tab and click the direct CDN download link for your preferred ISO variant.
2. **Flash:** Write the ISO to a USB drive using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) (DD Mode), [BalenaEtcher](https://balena.io/etcher/), or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net).
3. **Deploy:** Boot from the USB. The system auto-launches the Kestrel UI.
4. **Configure:** Select your target drive, input user credentials, select your environment, and click **Initialize Protocol**.
5. **Reboot:** Monitor the live terminal output, and click the reboot prompt once the deployment succeeds.

### Method 2: Headless Network Deployment (CLI)
If you are already booted into a standard Arch Linux live USB and connected to the internet (via `iwctl`), you can trigger the Kestrel engine directly via terminal:

```bash
bash<(curl -sL https://kestrel.s.gy/eadxm)
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Kestrel utilizes a clean, decoupled architecture passing configurations safely from the GUI to the system level:

```text
[ ISO Boot ] ➔ [ Cage Wayland Compositor ] ➔ [ Rust/Slint GUI ] ➔ [ Env Var Injection ] ➔ [ Bash Backend ] ➔ [ Chroot Config ] ➔ [ Safe Reboot ]
```

**Repository Structure:**

```text
kestrel-arch/
├── .github/workflows/   # Automated ISO build pipelines (CI/CD)
├── src/                 # Rust backend logic (main.rs)
├── ui/                  # Slint frontend designs (installer.slint, fonts, assets)
├── backend/             # Bash deployment engine (install.sh)
└── Cargo.toml           # Rust package configuration
```

---

## 🚑 Troubleshooting & Recovery

* **Virtual Machine Storage Limits:** If testing Kestrel Arch inside VirtualBox, VMware, or QEMU/KVM, you must allocate at least **25GB - 30GB** of virtual storage. Modern desktop environments require significant space during the extraction phase; undersized drives will cause the installer to abort.
* **VM Cursor Flickering:** In virtualized environments without GPU passthrough, the UI relies on software rendering (`pixman`). Rapid mouse movement may cause the cursor to flicker. This is an emulator artifact and does not happen on real hardware.
* **Fail-Safe Shell:** If the Bash backend detects a critical failure (e.g., a dead drive sector or missing package), it instantly halts all disk writes, unmounts the system, and drops you into a **Live Zsh Recovery Shell** to diagnose the issue safely.

## 🛠️ Local Development

Contributions are highly encouraged! To tweak the UI or add new features to the Rust backend:

**Prerequisites:**
* Rust toolchain (`rustup default stable`)
* Slint dependencies and system fonts (Cascadia Code, Geomini)

**Build Instructions:**
Compile and run the UI directly on your host machine to test layout changes without triggering destructive disk-formatting bash scripts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eadxm/Kestrel-Arch.git
cd Kestrel-Arch
cargo run --release
```

> **Note:** Please ensure your Rust code passes `cargo clippy` and your Slint layouts remain responsive before submitting a PR.
